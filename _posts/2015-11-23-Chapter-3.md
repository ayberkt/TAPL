# Exercise 3.5.5

Proof 3.3.4 uses structural induction.

# Exercise 3.3.4

__Induction on depth__

Let \\(s\\) be a term of arbitrary depth. We are given that
for every term \\(r\\) whose depth is smaller than the depth of \\(s\\),
\\(P(r)\\) holds. We need to show that \\(P(s)\\) holds for all \\(s\\) to prove
that _induction on depth_ works.

Let us define \\(Q(n) = ∀ s . depth(s) = n ⇒ P(s)\\).

Proof: by induction on \\(n\\).
Base case: \\(n = 1\\). \\(Q(true)\\), \\(Q(false)\\), \\(Q(0)\\) must
hold since they have depth 1.

Let us assume \\(Q(n)\\) holds for all \\(n = 1, \dots, k\\). We need to show
that \\(Q(k + 1)\\).

\\(Q(k + 1) = \forall s . depth(s) = k + 1 ⇒ P(s)\\). We have 4 cases for \\(s\\):

_Case 1:_ $$s$$ has form \\(succ~s'\\) where \\(s'\\) has depth \\(k\\).
So by our induction hypothesis, \\(P(s)\\) holds.

_Case 2:_ $$s$$ has form \\(pred~s'\\) where s' has depth \\(k\\) so
\\(P(s')\\) holds by our induction hypothesis.

_Case 3:_ $$s$$ has form \\(iszero~s'\\) where where s' has a smaller depth than that of s.
So P(s') holds by our induction hypothesis.

Case 4: $$s$$ has form \\(if s'_1~then~s'_2~else~s'_3\\) all of \\(s'_1, s'_2, s'_3\\)
have depths $$ = k$$. So \\(P(s)\\) holds on them too, by our induction
hypothesis.

So  \\(Q(n)\\) holds for all \\(n\\), which was what we needed to show.

__Induction on size__

The reasoning for this one is almost exacly the same for _induction on depth.
